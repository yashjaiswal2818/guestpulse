# 🔧 Authentication Error Fix

## ❌ The Problem

**Error:** `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'id')`

### Root Cause
The analytics page and API routes were missing authentication checks, causing `user` to be `undefined` when trying to access `user.id`.

---

## ✅ What Was Fixed

### 1. Analytics Page (`app/organizer/analytics/page.tsx`)
**Before:**
```typescript
export default async function AnalyticsPage() {
    // No auth check - user could be undefined!
    const baseUrl = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL || 'http://localhost:3000'
    // ...
}
```

**After:**
```typescript
export default async function AnalyticsPage() {
    const supabase = await createClient()
    
    // ✅ Check authentication
    const { data: { user } } = await supabase.auth.getUser()
    if (!user) {
        redirect('/login')
    }
    
    // Now user is guaranteed to exist
    // ...
}
```

---

### 2. Analytics API Routes
Updated all 4 analytics routes to require authentication and filter by user:

#### `/api/analytics/show-rate/route.ts` ✅
- Added authentication check
- Filters events by `organizer_id`
- Only shows data for user's events

#### `/api/analytics/hourly/route.ts` ✅
- Added authentication check
- Gets user's event IDs first
- Filters registrations to only user's events

#### `/api/analytics/rsvp-breakdown/route.ts` ✅
- Added authentication check
- Gets user's event IDs first
- Filters registrations to only user's events

#### `/api/analytics/teams/route.ts` ✅
- Added authentication check
- Gets user's event IDs first
- Filters registrations to only user's events

---

## 📝 Pattern Used

All analytics routes now follow this secure pattern:

```typescript
export async function GET() {
    try {
        // 1. Create authenticated Supabase client
        const supabase = await createClient()
        
        // 2. Check authentication
        const { data: { user } } = await supabase.auth.getUser()
        if (!user) {
            return NextResponse.json({ error: 'Unauthorized' }, { status: 401 })
        }

        // 3. Get user's events
        const { data: events } = await supabase
            .from('events')
            .select('id')
            .eq('organizer_id', user.id)  // ← Filter by user!

        const eventIds = events?.map(e => e.id) || []

        // 4. Query registrations only for user's events
        const { data: registrations } = await supabase
            .from('registrations')
            .select('*')
            .in('event_id', eventIds)  // ← Only user's events!

        // 5. Process and return data
        return NextResponse.json(chartData)
    } catch (error) {
        // Error handling
    }
}
```

## 🔐 Security Improvements

### Before Fix:
- ❌ Analytics page had no auth check
- ❌ Analytics APIs showed data for ALL users
- ❌ Anyone could access analytics endpoints
- ❌ Data leakage between tenants

### After Fix:
- ✅ Analytics page requires login
- ✅ Analytics APIs only show user's data
- ✅ 401 Unauthorized for unauthenticated requests
- ✅ Multi-tenant data isolation enforced

---

## 🧪 Testing

### Test Authentication:
```bash
# 1. Visit analytics page without logging in
http://localhost:3000/organizer/analytics
# Expected: Redirects to /login ✅

# 2. Login and visit analytics
# Expected: Shows only your data ✅

# 3. Try accessing API directly without auth
curl http://localhost:3000/api/analytics/show-rate
# Expected: {"error": "Unauthorized"} ✅
```

### Test Data Isolation:
```bash
# 1. As User A: Create events and registrations
# 2. Check analytics shows User A's data
# 3. Logout and login as User B
# 4. Check analytics shows ONLY User B's data
# Expected: Complete data isolation ✅
```

## 🚀 What's Now Secure

### All Organizer Pages ✅
- `/organizer` - Dashboard
- `/organizer/events` - Events list
- `/organizer/events/[id]` - Event details
- `/organizer/analytics` - Analytics ← Fixed!
- `/organizer/check-in` - Check-in

### All API Routes ✅
- `/api/events` - Events CRUD
- `/api/events/[id]` - Single event operations
- `/api/export` - CSV export
- `/api/analytics/show-rate` - Show rate data ← Fixed!
- `/api/analytics/hourly` - Hourly check-ins ← Fixed!
- `/api/analytics/rsvp-breakdown` - RSVP stats ← Fixed!
- `/api/analytics/teams` - Team performance ← Fixed!

## 📋 Next Steps

### 1. **Run Database Migration** (Required)
If you haven't already, run the SQL from `DATABASE_MIGRATION.md`:

```sql
ALTER TABLE events 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS organizer_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id);

CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_events_organizer_id ON events(organizer_id);
```

### 2. **Test the Fix**
```bash
# Start dev server
npm run dev

# Visit http://localhost:3000/organizer/analytics
# Should work without errors!
```

### 3. **Create Test Data**
```bash
# 1. Sign up at /signup
# 2. Create an event at /organizer/events/new
# 3. Submit some RSVPs
# 4. Check in some guests
# 5. View analytics at /organizer/analytics
```

## 💡 Why This Happened

The analytics feature was added earlier without full authentication implementation. Now that we've added user authentication:

1. Every page needs to check if user is logged in
2. Every API needs to verify authentication
3. Every query needs to filter by `organizer_id`

This is **standard multi-tenant security** - essential for production!

## 🎯 Summary

**Files Updated:** 5 files
- `app/organizer/analytics/page.tsx` - Added auth check
- `app/api/analytics/show-rate/route.ts` - Added auth + user filtering
- `app/api/analytics/hourly/route.ts` - Added auth + user filtering
- `app/api/analytics/rsvp-breakdown/route.ts` - Added auth + user filtering
- `app/api/analytics/teams/route.ts` - Added auth + user filtering

**Impact:**
- ✅ Error fixed: No more "Cannot read properties of undefined"
- ✅ Security improved: Data isolation enforced
- ✅ Authentication working: All routes protected
- ✅ Multi-tenancy working: Users see only their data
