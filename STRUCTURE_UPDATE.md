---

## 🎯 **What Changed**

### **Old Structure:**

    └── [eventId]/
        ├── page.tsx

            └── page.tsx
```

### **New Structure:**
```

├── page.tsx             ← Dashboard home/overview

└── events/
    ├── page.tsx         ← Events list
    ├── new/
    │   └── page.tsx     ← Create event form (coming soon)
    └── [id]/
        └── page.tsx     ← Event detail page
```

## 🔄 **Route Changes**

### **Updated Routes:**
| Old Route | New Route | Page |
|-----------|-----------|------|
| `/dashboard` | `/organizer` | Dashboard overview |
| `/dashboard/events` | `/organizer/events` | Events list |
| `/dashboard/events/[id]` | `/organizer/events/[id]` | Event details |

---

## 📝 **Files Updated**

### **1. Navigation & Layout**
- ✅ `app/organizer/layout.tsx` - Updated nav links to `/organizer/*`
- ✅ Added Analytics nav item

### **2. Landing Page**
- ✅ `app/page.tsx` - Updated dashboard links:
  - "Organizer Dashboard" → `/organizer`
  - "Get Started Free" → `/organizer`

### **3. Events List**
- ✅ `app/organizer/events/page.tsx` - Updated all event links:
  - "Manage" → `/organizer/events/{id}`
  - "Check-in" → `/organizer/check-in?event={id}`
  - RSVP Page link unchanged

### **4. New Pages Created**
- ✨ `app/organizer/check-in/page.tsx` - QR Scanner page
- ✨ `app/organizer/analytics/page.tsx` - Analytics (coming soon)
- ✨ `app/organizer/events/new/page.tsx` - Event creation (coming soon)

---

## 🎨 **New Features**

### **1. Check-in Page** (`/organizer/check-in`)
- ✅ QR Scanner component integration
- ✅ Back navigation to event
- ✅ Instructions card
- ✅ Event validation (requires event ID)

### **2. Analytics Page** (`/organizer/analytics`)
- ✅ Coming soon placeholder
- ✅ Feature previews: Attendance trends, Commitment scores, Event insights
- ✅ Professional "under construction" design

### **3. Create Event Page** (`/organizer/events/new`)
- ✅ Coming soon placeholder
- ✅ Numbered step preview

---

## 🧹 **Clean Up**

### **Old Route Group (Can be Deleted):**
```bash
# Optional: Remove old dashboard structure
rm -rf app/(organizer)/dashboard/
```

**Note:** The old `app/(organizer)/dashboard/` folder can now be safely deleted since all files have been moved to `app/organizer/`.

---

## 🚀 **Updated Navigation Flow**

```
Landing Page (/)
    ↓
Organizer Dashboard (/organizer)
    ├─→ Events List (/organizer/events)
    │   ├─→ Create Event (/organizer/events/new) [New]
    │   └─→ Event Details (/organizer/events/[id])
    │       └─→ Check-in Scanner (/organizer/check-in?event=[id]) [New]
    └─→ Analytics (/organizer/analytics) [New]
```

---

## ✅ **Benefits of New Structure**

### **1. Cleaner URLs**
- ❌ Before: `/dashboard/events/[eventId]/[id]`
- ✅ After: `/organizer/events/[id]`

### **2. Logical Organization**
- Check-in is now at `/organizer/check-in` (cleaner)
- Analytics has dedicated section
- Event creation has clear path

### **3. Consistent Naming**
- All routes use `/organizer/*` prefix
- No nested route groups
- Simpler mental model

### **4. Extensibility**
- Easy to add new sections (`/organizer/settings`, `/organizer/reports`, etc.)
- Clear separation of concerns
