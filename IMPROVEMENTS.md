# GuestPulse - Recent Improvements

## ✅ Completed Improvements

### 1. TypeScript Type Safety
**Files Updated:**
- `components/organizer/event-stats.tsx`
- `components/organizer/registrations-table.tsx`
- `components/organizer/teams-list.tsx`
- `app/(organizer)/dashboard/events/[eventId]/page.tsx`

**Changes:**
- Replaced `any[]` with proper `Registration[]` and `Event` types
- Imported types from `lib/types/database.ts`
- Added type safety throughout the organizer dashboard

### 2. Error Handling
**File:** `app/(organizer)/dashboard/events/[eventId]/page.tsx`

**Changes:**
- Added error boundary for registration fetch failures
- Display user-friendly error message with AlertCircle icon
- Graceful degradation when data fails to load
- Empty state handling for no team registrations

### 3. Team Check-in Feature
**File:** `components/organizer/teams-list.tsx`

**New Features:**
- Added "Check-in Entire Team" button
- Button only shows for teams with unchecked members
- Loading state with spinner animation
- Calls `/api/check-in` with `memberIds` array
- Success feedback and auto-refresh
- Shows number of members to be checked in

**How It Works:**
1. Organizer clicks "Check in X member(s)" button
2. Frontend sends POST request with array of member IDs
3. API checks in all pending members simultaneously
4. Page refreshes to show updated check-in status

### 4. Enhanced Analytics
**File:** `app/(organizer)/dashboard/events/[eventId]/page.tsx`

**Improvements:**
- Added percentage bars for meal preferences
- Shows both count and percentage
- Visual progress bars for better data visualization
- Handles empty states (0 registrations)

### 5. Empty State Handling
**Multiple Files**

**Improvements:**
- Empty state card for teams with no registrations
- Better messaging when no data is available
- Consistent UI patterns across components

## 🎯 API Integration

### Team Check-in Endpoint
**Endpoint:** `POST /api/check-in`

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "memberIds": ["uuid1", "uuid2", "uuid3"]
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "checkedIn": [...], // Array of updated registrations
  "count": 3
}
```

**Features:**
- Batch check-in multiple users
- Single API call for entire team
- Atomic operation (all succeed or all fail)

- Type safety prevents runtime errors
- Graceful error handling prevents page crashes
